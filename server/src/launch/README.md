# TODO
* similar launch description launch files as ROS2
* ROS2 similar config where nodename is automatic, created if doesn't exist under a config/{configSetName}/*
* Alias topics in config (and node name) (alias id ?) all are powerful .. subscriptions and publish topics + aliases lists
* launch/launch_file.js also available
